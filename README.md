# ML.NET Samples

This is a .NET 6 Console Application that uses ML.NET's Auto ML to train a multi-class classification algorithm to predict the ESRB rating of video games based on the features of that game such as violence, drug or alcohol references, nudity, language, etc.

Data for this project came from Mohammed Alhamad's [Video Game Rating by ESRB dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/imohtn/video-games-rating-by-esrb) on Kaggle.
